Title: Cholesterol Ratio Calculator

Description:

A tool that assists people in calculating their cholesterol ratio and the ratio of their "good" cholesterol (HDL) to their "bad" cholesterol (LDL). 
The Cholesterol Ratio Calculator will compute a user's cholesterol ratio when they enter their cholesterol levels (HDL, LDL, triglycerides), 
and it will then give them a result that falls into one of four categories: ideal, good, high, or too high. A person with a healthy cholesterol ratio 
has a minimal risk of acquiring heart disease (ideal). Whereas a high cholesterol ratio denotes a significant risk, a good cholesterol ratio denotes an 
average risk. A high risk of getting heart disease is indicated by an excessive cholesterol ratio. Along with the calculator, the program will also 
include a diet and exercise plan to promote fitness and a healthier lifestyle.

Features:

The total cholesterol and ratio values will be simultaneously calculated and displayed after the input of the three measurements.
A user login and registration system.
A measurement converter for mmol/L to mg/dL.
Based on the resulting ratio, the calculator will also show the user an indication of whether or not the results are ideal and its description:

For LDL-HDL ratio:

Ideal: < 2.0
Good: < 5.0
Too high: > 5.0

For Triglycerides-HDL ratio:

Ideal: < 2.0
High: 4.0 - 6.0
Too high: > 6.0
