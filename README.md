Title: Cholesterol Ratio Calculator

Description:
\n A tool that assists people in calculating their cholesterol ratio and the ratio of their "good" cholesterol (HDL) to their "bad" cholesterol (LDL). 
The Cholesterol Ratio Calculator will compute a user's cholesterol ratio when they enter their cholesterol levels (HDL, LDL, triglycerides), 
and it will then give them a result that falls into one of four categories: ideal, good, high, or too high. A person with a healthy cholesterol ratio 
has a minimal risk of acquiring heart disease (ideal). Whereas a high cholesterol ratio denotes a significant risk, a good cholesterol ratio denotes an 
average risk. A high risk of getting heart disease is indicated by an excessive cholesterol ratio. Along with the calculator, the program will also 
include a diet and exercise plan to promote fitness and a healthier lifestyle.
